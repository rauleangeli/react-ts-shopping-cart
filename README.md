# react-ts-shopping-cart

A shopping cart emulator created with React + Vite + TS

This project includes features as:

- Creation of custom React Hook
- Use of TS for the building of App, components and database file
- Use of basic React Hooks like UseState and UseEffect

On this cart emulator you can add multiple products (guitars) to the cart. Also you can modify quantities, increase or decrease items, and empty the whole cart. All this actions will also show the total amount to pay, depending on the products added to cart.

Finally, the cart is persistent, as it saves the products on the LocalStorage, so you can refresh the browser and the products will remain in the cart.
